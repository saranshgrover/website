Hey! I'm Saransh. I'm a [UX Engineer](https://medium.com/google-design/why-full-stack-developers-make-the-best-ux-engineers-1ddbff6c1739) based in Chicago. I'm a builder at heart who's passionate about creating people-first products.

Currently, I work as a UX Developer at [CoinFlip](https://www.coinflip.tech) where I lead development of web experiences across the company.

Prior to that, I received my Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland, was a UX Engineer at [Soliyarn](https://www.soliyarn.com), and a Frontend Engineer at [Vyer Technologies](https://www.vyer.com).

When I'm not optimizing user flows or developing UI components, I enjoy [Speedcubing](https://wca.link/2014GROV01) and lead the World Cube Association Marketing Team.
