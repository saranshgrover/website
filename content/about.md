Hey! I'm Saransh. I am a Graduate Student at University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction program. As a researcher, designer and technology lover, my mission is to use technology and design to work towards social good and tackle complex problems in social media, e-commerce and news media.

Most recently, in Summer 2022 I was UX Design Intern at [Soliyarn](https://www.soliyarn.com) where I led the project to launch a web portal for the management and visualization of bio-sensing and motion sensing garments.

At UMD, I work at the STAMP Student Union as a Design Graduate Assistant where I work with a team of student and pro-staff designers and have delivered over 30 design projects to over 10 clients. In particular, I have worked on redesigning the STAMP website to focus on information hierarchy and event visibility.

I also am a Graduate Student Researcher at the Computational Journalism Lab, where I am advised by Dr Naeemul Hassan on my thesis which aims to research crowdsourcing solutions to tackle misinformation on the popular short-formed video platform TikTok.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. I have also been lucky to work at companies like Vyer Technologies, as well as spending a summer with the New York Yankees.

I'm a builder at my core. Whether it be with code, design, writing or just legos. I also thrive on challenges - I learnt how to solve a Rubik's cube because of a challenge, and it led me to a continental record and a Top 10 world ranking. This is what drives my design process - I love experimenting, countlessly prototyping, researching, and challenging myself till satisfaction.
