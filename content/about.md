Hey! I'm Saransh. I am a Graduate Student at University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction program where I spend my time researching problems and designing solutions for our modern media landscape.

At UMD, I'm a recent addition to the Computational Journalism Lab where I work on projects like analyzing misleading headlines
for news articles, categorize COVID-19 fake cure headlines and explore how to visualize misinformation.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. I have also been lucky to work at companies like Vyer Technologies, as well as spending a summer with the New York Yankees.

I'm a builder at my core. Whether it be with code, design, writing or just legos. I also thrive on challenges - I learnt how to solve a Rubik's cube because of a challenge, and it led me to a continental record and a Top 10 world ranking. This is what drives my design process - I love experimenting, countlessly prototyping, researching, and challenging myself till satisfaction.
