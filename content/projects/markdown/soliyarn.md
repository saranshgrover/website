# Visualizing Your Garments

Over the Summer of 2022, I worked as a Product Design Intern at Soliyarn. Soliyarn is an e-textile startup based in Boston creating sensor-based garments for military, industrial and personal use. 

At Soliyarn, I worked to design and create the Web Portal that was used to manage, connect to and visualize the physical garments created by Soliyarn. 

## Overview

While smart, sensor equipped garments are growing in popularity, not many interfaces have been created that allow different clients to connect to their garments and see data through real-time visualizations relevant to their needs.

In addition, Soliyarn has a line of products that aim to be created for both business use, as well as personal use. Thus, any interface must be **adaptable** and **error-free** to allow for commercial and personal use.

The goal for this project was to create a coherent and modular infrastructure and interface that lets Soliyarn's varied clients easily access and interact with their biosensing garments and visualizations.

## My Work

I was responsible for **designing the structure of the web portal**, closely working with other engineers, designers and project managers. In particular, I worked to **design user flows by creating flow charts for paths taken by users**. These were designs for different stakeholders of the product - the business owners and managers, the clients, and customers. 

I also focused on creating prototypes on Figma for two main workflows:

- The first was **prototypes for the configuration user flow** which was responsible for the configuration of a new device. This included users initially connecting their device via bluetooth, downloading and updating any necessary software, and customizing specific details like name, icon and other variables like refresh rate. 
- The second workflow was what we called the **Device Visualization Interface**, which was the interface where customers could connect to their garment and be able to visualize the real-time data collection through different visualizations based on the kind of garment. This involved creating 3-D real-time visual 

I also worked to **further develop the visualizations** of the products. For this, I had to work closely with systems and software engineers to understand the capabilities and limitations of the products. **I re-developed the visualization** using a 3-D modelling libary called [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and the Web Canvas API to ensure the visualizations were capable to work with the prototypes created while keeping in mind the limitations of the product.

*Unfortunately since this work is under a NDA - I cannot publicy share my designs. If you are interested in learning more, please [contact me](mailto:contact@saranshgrover.com)*

## Impact

- In my 3 months at Soliyarn, I was a key part of the **team behind fully shipping the web portal**. Not only did we achieve our timeline, we also delivered more features than promised. 
- This new portal, created for usage starting in September 2022 played a role in **acquiring new business partners** who visualized their data collected in real-time through Soliyarns' products
- Overall, through designing and improving the visualization interface, I **increased the visualization efficiency of the product protocol by over 50%**
